<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Thank you very much for spending time on my website. 
  <br>
  My name is Florian and I got into the tech space because I spontaneously tried learning Python. 
  Since I enjoyed it, researching and learning simmilar topics was a clear objective for me. So I took a course in Data Science and Cyber Security. Both were very interesting, but didn't still my hunger.
  So I started learning HTML to get into Web Debelopment. Looking forward to really being able to build interesting websites for me and other folks.

  Thank you again for taking time out of your day to visit my website.
